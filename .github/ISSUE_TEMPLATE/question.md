First, make sure to examine [the docs](https://djinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If that doesn't help, we recommend one of these 3 main channels:

- If your issue is related to Django + something else but was generated with djinit, the best is to post a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/djinit) tagged with `djinit`, you would get more visibility from other communities as well.
- Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uFXweDQc5a) and ask around.
- Start [a discussion](https://github.com/khulnasoft/djinit/discussions) on our project's GitHub.
